<h1><i>Can I Use The Same Shortcut Keys On Mac or Linux Computers?</i></h1>
<br><br>

The shortcut keys in Windows 11 are designed specifically for the Windows operating system and may not directly translate to Mac or Linux systems. However, there are ways to use Windows 11 and its shortcuts on a Mac:<br>

 * Windows 365 Cloud PCs: You can stream a full Windows 11 experience to Mac computers, which would allow you to use Windows shortcuts.
<p> * Parallels Desktop: This software allows you to run Windows 11 on Mac computers, including those with M1, M2, and M3 chips. You can use Windows shortcuts within the virtualized Windows environment.
</p><p> * Remapping Keys: Some users remap their Mac keyboard keys to match Windows shortcuts when using Windows 11 through Parallels Desktop.
</p><p>
For Linux, while the exact Windows shortcuts may not work, there are similar shortcuts you can use, and some may even be identical due to common conventions. Additionally, you can run Linux alongside Windows 11 using tools like the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Hyper-V, which would allow you to use Windows shortcuts within the Windows environment⁶⁷. There are also universal shortcuts that work across both Windows and Linux, like Ctrl+C for copy and Ctrl+V for paste.
</p>
Remember, the effectiveness of these methods can vary based on the specific hardware and software configurations of your Mac or Linux system.

<h1><i>How To Create New Shortcut Keys In Windows 11?</i></h1>
<br><br>
<font face="Cambria" color="black" size="4.5"><b>
Creating a new shortcut key in Windows 11 is quite straightforward. Here's a quick guide on how to do it:<br>

1. *Find the application* or folder you want to create a shortcut for.<p>
2. *Right-click* on it and select *Create shortcut* or *Send to > Desktop (create shortcut) * if it's a folder.</p>
<p>3. Once the shortcut is created on the desktop, *right-click* on it and select *Properties*.
</p><p>4. In the Properties window, switch to the *Shortcut* tab.
</p><p>5. Click on the *Shortcut key* field and press the key combination you want to use as the shortcut. Windows will automatically prepend "Ctrl + Alt" to the key you press.
</p><p>6. Click *OK* to save the changes.</p>
<p>
Now, whenever you press your chosen key combination, Windows will open the application or folder linked to that shortcut. Remember, if you move the shortcut to another location, the key combination will no longer work, so make sure it stays on the desktop if you want to keep using the shortcut key.</p>
