<font face= "Cambria" color="black"> a) Windows 11 shortcut keys can significantly enhance your productivity in several ways:
<p>
 * Swifter Navigation: Shortcuts let you bypass the mouse and menus, streamlining tasks like switching between windows (Alt + Tab) or minimizing all open windows (Win + M).</p>
<p> * Effortless File Management: Essential shortcuts for copying (Ctrl + C), cutting (Ctrl + X), and pasting (Ctrl + V) expedite file manipulation.</p>
 <p>* Enhanced Multitasking: Snap Assist (Win + arrow keys) enables efficient window organization by snapping them to specific screen zones, while Task View (Win + Tab) offers a quick overview of all open windows and desktops.</p>
 <p>* Streamlined Search: The Windows search bar (Win + S) lets you instantly search for files, applications, or settings, eliminating the need to navigate through folders.</p>
<p>Mastering these shortcuts can significantly improve your workflow and free up valuable time for other tasks.</p>

<p> * Clipboard Management: Win + V opens Clipboard History, letting you paste previously copied items without having to copy them again.</p>
